= Deoplete GitHub completion =

deoplete-gh is a #modern GitHub completion plugin for vim#.
Works fast and securely.

== Features ==
Fast::
Combination of *deoplete* and *GitHub GraphiQL API* speeds up completion. +
All the information is fetched by only one api hit for each of the user/issue completion. +
You're also free from API rate limit!
Secure::
Delegate authorization process to https://github.com/cli/cli[GitHubâ€™s official command line tool]. +
No need to prepare new token and worry about security risk of writing it into `~/.bashrc`. +
You can do all the things in private repository with ease!

== Completion targets ==
All completion will be done based on current working directory and on `gitcommit` filetype.

* When you started to type `+#[number]+` or `+#[title]+`, deoplete-gh lists up the opened issues and pull requests with full titles and substitute them to correct `+#[number]+`. +
  The most recently opened one shows up the first.
* When you started to type `@[login name]`, it lists up who commented to or created issue/pull requests. +
  Who talks most shows up the first.

== Dependencies ==
* https://github.com/cli/cli[GitHub CLI]
* https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim[Deoplete]
